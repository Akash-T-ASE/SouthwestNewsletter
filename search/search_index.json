With applications spanning across multiple clouds, both public and private, the distributed nature of modern networks presents new challenges for security. Attack methodologies have evolved as well, with a shift away from malware-centric approaches towards exploiting credentials to infiltrate networks and maneuver laterally, necessitating a reevaluation of conventional security paradigms. </p> <p>Traditional network boundaries, such as VLANs and VRFs, often prove inadequate for enforcing robust security policies in these dynamic environments. There arises a need for more flexible and granular control over intra-segment communication and the grouping of endpoints dispersed across various VLANs. </p> <p>Arista's Multi-Domain Segmentation Services (MSS) addresses these challenges by enabling the creation of micro-perimeters that restrict intra-segment communication and facilitate the grouping of endpoints for streamlined security policy enforcement. Departing from the conventional reliance on network subnets for access control, Arista MSS leverages tags assigned to endpoints, allowing for more nuanced policy enforcement based on these tags. Each endpoint can be associated with multiple tags, providing enhanced granularity in access control.</p> <p> Arista Multi-Domain Segmentation Services </p> <p>A brief explanation of Arista MSS is shown above. Let\u2019s take a look at this: </p> <p>a) By identifying the endpoints of a network, we can keep a record of all the endpoints to where traffic is traveling. By utilizing this data, you can parse through information faster to identify the source cause of potential attacks.  </p> <p>b) Traffic maps help create policies allowing expected traffic to pass along. This gives users the ability to apply additional rules for further enhancement of traffic flow.  </p> <p>c) Applying Microperimeter practices allows or denies specified traffic. The traffic can also be redirected to travel to the firewalls set up in your existing infrastructure.  </p> <p>d) Observing the network traffic by applying the previous steps above gives you the access to gain visibility to your network. Additional changes can be made as applications are added into the infrastructure.</p> <p>Arista MSS further allows for us to provide you better tools for a Zero Trust Network equipped with best practices of monitoring endpoints as well as sourcing potential threats. As an effort to simplify our tools,  Arista MSS requires NO custom software or custom protocols to utilize our solution. Interested in learning more?

Applying configurations via Configlets is a great method for the network team to push multiple changes onto various devices, as well as save significant time during maintenance windows. Along with Configlets, another feature called Studios can further assist in tracking changes, in addition to deploying new fabrics within the network environment. Rather than utilizing the feature separately, why not combine the two together?  To enhance the capabilities of tracking configuration changes, we take a look at a feature called Studios Static Configlets!  </p> <p>Let\u2019s take a look at the differences in workflow between traditional Configlets and Studio Static Configlets. Below is a table of Configlets in a CloudVision instance:  </p> <p> Configlet Table</p> <p>In a typical operation, each device\u2019s configlet is stored in this table. While it is great to know that you can use the search bar to find a specific configlet for the device of interest, the fact is that there should be a more efficient manner to organize configlets per device. Below is a picture of CloudVision Studio\u2019s Static Configlet:</p> <p> Studios Static Configlet</p> <p>Rather than storing every single configlet from every device, we can place devices in a hierarchy manner, and store configlets within those devices! As shown above, Spine 1 has multiple tabs on the right, within each tab is a configlet that stores configurations pertaining to the device. This feature has simplified the Configlet\u2019s table by allowing you to organize the configlets per device.  </p> <p>Another tool integrated in Studio's Static Configlet is the hierarchy model. Take a look at the devices on the left panel. Every device has the option of inheriting the child device\u2019s configurations. Example: Spine 1 and Spine 2 are the \u201cchildren\u201d of Tenant. You can enable the hierarchy schema for Tenant to inherit both Spine 1 and Spine 2 configurations. This allows for the tenant instance to collect configurations without the hassle of you specifically having to create a separate configlet by itself.  </p> <p>Optimizing the workflow of device operations by using Studio Static Configlets will lead to enhanced operations for your Arista devices. Studio\u2019s delivers various other features as well to manage multiple devices in a simplified manner. Although Studio\u2019s does take additional learning to maximize its capabilities, the knowledge is fairly easy to grasp!
