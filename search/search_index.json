To address these risks, a series of strategic architectural measures are essential. These include deploying a strong Network Admission Control (NAC), establishing identity-aware microperimeters, and maintaining continuous monitoring with tools such as Network Detection and Response (NDR). </p> <p>Implementing a solution like Network Detection and Response (NDR) requires access to traffic across various segments of the network. While this is relatively straightforward in a datacenter with a centralized tap aggregation network, replicating this setup in an enterprise LAN that connects users and devices can be challenging. Installing sensors in every Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF) can be operationally complex, and creating a distributed packet capture network, though feasible, introduces both commercial and technical difficulties, increasing overall complexity. As a result, many enterprises may be daunted by these challenges and continue to operate with an assumed level of risk due to the lack of continuous monitoring recommended by Zero Trust Networking principles. </p> <p>Arista has introduced an innovative solution to address this challenge by deploying an NDR agent directly on the campus edge switches. As user and device traffic flows through these switches, they not only handle standard L2/L3 forwarding but also function as NDR sensors. These switches can inspect the traffic, perform detailed Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) analysis, and send summarized reports from each switch-based sensor to the backend analytics engine, Nucleus. The Nucleus analytics engine can be hosted either in the public cloud or on-premises via a Campus Nucleus. </p> <p>The distributed NDR sensor architecture within and Arista Campus design is depicted below.  </p> <p> </p> <p>This elegant architecture allows customers to enable continuous security monitoring in the enterprise without introducing any new hardware than what they would already have for providing connectivity to users and devices within the enterprise network.</p> <p>Here are the functions of Arista distributed switch based sensor.</p> <p>Profile: Know what's on your network </p> <ul> <li>Discover, profile, and track devices, users and applications using AI-based fingerprinting</li> </ul> <p>Detect: Find bad behavior</p> <ul> <li>Detect sophisticated threats with the lowest noise possible</li> <li>Find indicators of compreomise </li> </ul> <p>To learn more about Arista\u2019s unique and novel approach to enabling NDR in a distributed enterprise network, please visit</p> <p>Links for additional information: Arista NDR Campus Datasheet </p>"},{"location":"#arista-zero-touch-provisioning-from-zero-to-hero-in-20-minutes","title":"Arista Zero Touch Provisioning: \"From Zero to Hero, in 20 minutes\"","text":"<p>By: Alex Bojko, Advanced Services Engineer Southwest Region</p> <p>Arista ZTP (Zero Touch Provisioning) is a day 0 feature to help you get your network up and running with minimal user intervention. There are a handful of frustrating pain points that come along with deploying new network switches. From sitting at your desk with the new switch plugged in and powered up, creating an ear piercing humming while you attempt to push initial configuration onto the device over CLI. Or standing in a data center, having just racked and cabled the device up, attempting to console in and push new configuration onto the device. Neither of these scenarios are fun, and both can be completely avoided thanks to Arista ZTP.  </p> <p>ZTP is a process within EOS that is enabled by default on every Arista switch. When the device boots up, and no startup-config file is found, the switch will boot into \"ZTP mode\". When in ZTP mode, the switch will put any active port (ethernet or management interface) into the \"no switchport\" state and attempt to reach out and connect to a DHCP server. If no DHCP server is found, the switch will keep attempting to locate one, and the device will remain in a non-fully-functional state. At this point, you can disable ZTP for one boot cycle using the command \"zerotouch cancel\" or disable the feature all together using the command \"zerotouch disable\". However, this is an article about leveraging the power of ZTP, so let's dive into exactly how you can use it to your advantage.   </p> <p>ZTP allows you to deploy all the initial configuration you would like onto the new device without ever touching the CLI. You can also automate the provisioning of the software image you would like the device to run as part of the ZTP process.  </p> <p>The ZTP process works as follows: </p> <ol> <li> <p>The switch is initially powered on, no startup-config file is located, and DHCP query packets are sent out all connected ethernet and management interfaces.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The device receives a DHCP offer from the DHCP server, and gets an IP address.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Within option 67 of the DHCP offer, a network URL to a file server is specified.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The switch connects to the file server, and retrieves a script or configuration file based on a variety of identifiers, such as its MAC address or serial number.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The switch executes the script or configuration file, automatically provisioning itself based on the information contained within the file. This can include both configuration and software image provisioning.   </p> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>Once the ZTP process is finished, you now have a network device that has all the initial configuration it needs to get up and running, as well as the desired software image, all without ever having to touch the CLI of the device.   </p> <p>To learn more about ZTP, including how it works in CVaaS, view the following links below:  Detailed ZTP Overview ZTP in CVaaS </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
