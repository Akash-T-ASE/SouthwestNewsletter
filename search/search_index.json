Here is a chart that represents some statistics, including the sources of the statistics. The two statistics that I find particularly valuable are that 42% of the breaches are internal and that 90% of the companies will have a security breach. Given those things, how is the enterprise best positioned to minimize its impact if a security breach happens? </p> <p> </p> <p>This is where the idea of identity-aware microperimeters comes into play. We recommend customers decouple the security policy from the underlying topology. Customers have often used the network topology as one way to define the security perimeter, but in the current security landscape, that is not sufficient and leaves the customer vulnerable. If you look at the first picture below, you will see the current security architecture. Once the user/device is granted access to the network, they are free to roam around the network and move about laterally. The critical concept of zero trust is to minimize the lateral movement and allow access to any resource in the network explicitly and only if needed. In an ideal state, we want to get what is represented in the second visual below.  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>With the goal of the above-mentioned end state in mind, Arista is introducing a groundbreaking security architecture called Multi-Domain Segmentation Services (MSS). This innovative solution empowers customers to establish identity-aware security perimeters across all network domains (campus, DC, and WAN) using a single EOS across the entire network.  </p> <p>MSS allows customers to decouple the security policy from the underlying network topology and design a security policy based on asset tags (devices, users, VMs). These tags can either be defined manually (less desirable) or imported into other systems that naturally maintain the identity of the endpoints (Vcenter for VM tags), Network Access Control or NAC  systems for end users, and device tags.  </p> <p>Another important aspect of this security architecture is knowing the patterns of communication. Without that, it's impossible to come up with the right policy. Arista is providing an MSS monitor node that monitors all communications, letting the network and security operator audit those communications and permit/deny each set of flows.  </p> <p>MSS delivers four key capabilities:   </p> <pre><code>1. Endpoint identity and microperimeter tags  \n2. \u201cZero Trust\u201d policy planning with traffic map  \n3. Microperimeter enforcement in the network or redirect to Firewall    \n4. Continuous Traffic monitoring and visibility of policy violations\n</code></pre> <p>Learn more about Arista MSS solution by clicking below: Arista MSS Addition Information Here </p>"},{"location":"#design-consideration-to-buffer-or-not-to-buffer","title":"Design Consideration: To Buffer or not to Buffer","text":"<p>By: Hue McGraw, Systems Engineer, Southwest Region</p> <p>When it comes to designing a modern-day Data Center, it\u2019s important to understand the different workflows you might have to address and where, within your DC, will traffic have the potential to be introduced to congestion.  Where is deep buffing needed?  </p> <p> </p> <p>To understand where deep buffering is needed, let\u2019s think about how the Transmit Control Packet protocol works.  TCP is a layer four stateful error correction protocol.  After a three-way handshake, TCP establishes a window and starts a data flow that slowly starts ramping up to port speed (Building trust) if no errors are occurring.  Once an error occurs (Breaking the trust), TCP drops the window size down by half and once again, slowly starts ramping up.  </p> <p>As congestion tends to impact multiple flows, over time multiple (or all) flows will tend to grow at the same rate, and throttle at the same rate, Increasing the change of microburst congestion and wasting bandwidth.</p> <p> </p> <p>The picture above shows two things.  The firsts thing that it shows is that large buffers give for a very fair averaging of flows.  And second, In low buffer switches, a certain number of flows on 10G links can have as low as 5% of the average speed.  In this test, that meant that 7 flows were sending data at 12Mbps on a 10G link (Not good)!  This is what happens when users complain of slow speeds on specific hosts, but the network looks fine.  Finger pointing begins and it\u2019s because your switches have low buffers.  This is because congestion happens when a device receives more traffic than it can buffer or send out of an egress port.  A Congested network produces symptoms such as packet loss, low throughput, and high latency.  </p> <p>Methods of preventing congestion  </p> <ul> <li>QoS</li> <li>Flow Control / Priority Flow Control</li> <li>Buffer tuning</li> <li>Increasing Bandwidth of the interface</li> </ul> <p>To learn more about Buffers, visit the links below:  Big Data Big Buffer Whitepaper Deploying Storage Net White Paper How To Troubleshoot Congestion </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
