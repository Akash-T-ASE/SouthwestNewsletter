A recent survey conducted by Forrester Research revealed a startling statistic: a staggering 77% of firms fell victim to breaches in 2023. The inevitability of security breaches has transformed from a question of \"if\" to \"when.\" It often feels like a game of whack-a-mole for security professionals, where one vulnerability is patched only for another to surface. However, amidst these challenges, there lies an opportunity to approach security strategically, fortifying our networks with greater resilience and protection. </p> <p>Established organizations recognize that breaches are an unfortunate reality. With this acknowledgment, they craft security policies aimed at minimizing the impact of any potential breaches. Moreover, there's a growing awareness that many security threats originate from within the organization itself, underscoring the importance of creating a robust network foundation and security policies capable of defending against both internal and external attacks. </p> <p>Arista is at the forefront of tackling the zero-trust challenge by aligning with recommendations from the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). According to CISA, the network serves as the nucleus of a mature zero-trust security architecture. Networking teams wield considerable influence in elevating the entire enterprise's security posture by embracing these crucial recommendations for enterprise networks. </p> <p> Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency Recommendations</p> <p>In following the recommendations from CISA, Arista is providing solutions across seven key areas identified for zero-trust maturity. Implementing these recommendations is a journey, not a destination. While it may not happen overnight, committing to a zero-trust architecture can significantly enhance enterprise security, reducing susceptibility to both internal and external security threats.</p> <p> Arista's Pillars of Zero Trust Security</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"Arista is at the forefront of tackling the zero-trust challenge by aligning with recommendations from the Cybersecurity &amp; Instrastructure Security Agency\"</p> <p>Learn more about these seven Arista architectural pillars of zero trust security by clicking here and here</p>"},{"location":"#high-performance-wi-fi-today-and-tomorrow","title":"High Performance Wi-Fi Today and Tomorrow","text":"<p>By Dang Nguyen, SE Manager Arizona/ San Diego Region </p> <p>Technology has become an integral part of daily life and, at times, a bare necessity. Ultra-fast, reliable connectivity to information and applications is critical, especially for devices on the go.  Wireless LAN has evolved and grown in many ways to become the preferred and, at times, primary connectivity method.  Let\u2019s take a high-level look at the current state of Wi-Fi 7, its benefits and challenges. </p> <p>Wi-Fi 7 is the latest technology in this space and has undoubtedly built upon and improved on the most significant update to the Wi-Fi Spectrum since 1999 to increase speed, capacity, and efficiency. </p> Release Year WiFi Name Standards Frequency Bands 1999 Wi-Fi 1 802.11b (1 to 11 Mbits/s) 2.4 GHz 1999 Wi-Fi 2 802.11a (1.5 to 54 Mbits/s) 5 Ghz 2003 Wi-Fi 3 802.11g (3 to 54 Mbits/s) 2.4 Ghz 2009 Wi-Fi 4 802.11n (72 to 600 Mbits) 2.4/5 Ghz 2014 Wi-Fi 5 802.11ac (433 to 6933 Mbits) 5 Ghz 2019 Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax (600 to 9608 Mbits) 2.4/5 Ghz 2020 Wi-Fi 6E 802.11ax (600 to 9608 Mbits) 6 Ghz <p>It holds the promise of theoretic speeds above 30Gbps while reducing latency and providing for the support of multiple simultaneous devices.  It will utilize even wider channels than Wi-Fi 6E leveraging the new 802.11be standards to provide for this improved performance.  The standard has also introduced a clever innovation to get around interference in the form of preamble puncturing.  These and other advancements will pave a path for transformational applications throughout many industries, from education to manufacturing.  These applications will range from extended reality that requires high-fidelity visuals and low latency to the ever-increasing demand of enterprise network workloads that require high performance from the wired and now wireless infrastructure.  With all this performance, the new standard also brings additional security with Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) with unique keys for each session.  This prevents attackers from decrypting past communications should they be able to obtain the key. </p> <p>The allure of new technology and its promises can surely be enticing, but we need to recognize the current challenges.  The most challenging yet most hard to define is that it is still in development, and there may be obstacles yet to be seen.  One of the biggest known challenges will be compatibility of end user devices and also routers and switches.  Due to the higher energy requirements, there will be higher power consumption on the part of the access points and also the for end devices.  Currently very few of these end user devices have been released that support the new standard.  Infrastructure will also need to be upgraded to accommodate to take full advantage of the increased speeds.</p> <p>For current deployments of wireless LAN, Wi-Fi 6E is the viable option.  It is a more mature technology within the access point itself and also supported endpoints.  It utilizes the same 6 GHz spectrum as Wi-Fi 7 but is more cost effective itself, with most infrastructures already capable of supporting the power and bandwidth requirements.  The benefits of this technology are more immediate, yet still offers future proofing.</p> <p>Learn more about Wi-Fi and Arista specific solutions: Wi-Fi 7: A Leap Towards Time-Sensitive Networking Wi-Fi 6E and Future-Proofing Wireless Infrastruture Arista Cognitive Wi-Fi </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
