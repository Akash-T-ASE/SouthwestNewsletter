Welcome to the January 2024 newsletter for Arista customers in the U.S. Southwest Region. Have you utilized Arista\u2019s new solution, AGNI? In this month\u2019s informative article on the AI-driven network identifer solution, our Systems Engineer, Alan Sukiennik, explains the innovative tool and its benefits in large enterprise and service provider networks. </p> <p>There is no question about the importance python has contributed to IT automation. What\u2019s more interesting is the use of python in creating event handlers in case of unwanted activity on your network. Our second article, written by our SE Hue McGraw, elaborates on running scripts to help you automate monitoring various types of events in your production networks. </p> <p>We welcome your feedback on the newsletter.

AGNI is cloud-delivered software-as-a-service and is built on a fully modern cloud-native, API-first, microservices architecture to provide a seamless user experience without latency or service disruptions.</p> <p>AGNI provides simple self-serving onboarding using a single sign-on for wireless unique PSKs and 802.1x digital certificates, cloud-native PKI infrastructure, authorization and segmentation, behavioral profiling and visibility for all connected devices and users. Devices are discovered, profiled, and classified into groups for identity-based segmentation, single pain-of-glass visibility and control.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>\"Arista AGNI requires no hardware, complex planning, or expensive professional services\"</p> <p>AGNI integrates with network infrastructure devices (wired switches and wireless access points) through a highly secure TLS-based RadSec tunnel. The highly secure and encrypted tunnel offers complete protection to the communications that happen in a distributed network environment. RadSec mechanism offers much greater security to AAA workflows when compared with traditional RADIUS environment workflows, which are not encrypted.</p> <p>Arista\u2019s Autonomous Virtual Assist, or AVA is the core to Arista\u2019s Zero-Trust networking approach. AVA brings the human cognitive expertise through AI-based learned information about the state of devices and users\u2019 experience on the network. AGNI introduces a new capability called Ask AVA, which can be used to interpret input from the users and network operators provided in a natural human language, derive intent, and allow the network operators troubleshoot issues and get to their Root Causes quickly and efficiently. AVA can also provide prescriptive guidance for the remediation of those issues. The use cases include errors in network provisioning and configuration, security troubleshooting, and even failure forecasting Overall AVA helps to simplify operations, reduce the mean-time-to-value, increase effectiveness, and reduce human errors. </p> <p>AGNI integrates with all the leading identity (SSO) providers. </p> <p>AGNI can also be easily integrated with other Arista solutions, such as CVP, EOS group-based macro-segmentation (MSS-G), NDR, as well as third-party XDR, EDR, MDM and SIEM products for post-admission control functionality.  </p> <p>For more information on AGNI, Click here</p>"},{"location":"#event-handler-and-the-power-of-python","title":"Event-Handler And The Power Of Python","text":"<p>By Hue McGraw, SE SouthWest Region</p> <p> Flexroute Workflow</p> <p>In a modern network, automation plays a crucial role in helping to avoid unwanted behaviors and maintaining network continuity.  In some cases, issues can develop from outside of your control, no matter how well architected your network infrastructure may be.  In many cases, these issues can be quickly addressed by implementing an event-handler strategy.  For those readers who are unfamiliar with event handler or how it works, here it is in a nutshell: </p> <p>An event handler executes a Linux bash shell command in response to a specific system event.  It consists of a Bash command, a trigger, and a delay.  When the trigger event occurs, the action is scheduled to run after delay seconds.</p> <p>These commands are available in event-handler configuration mode:  - action bash  - delay  - trigger </p> <p>So, as you can see, Event-handler by itself gives you the flexibility to monitor conditions within your environment and trigger an action to automate a task.  By simply utilizing the fastCli in bash, you have a quick and easy way to perform a change withing your Arista devices.  For example:</p> <p>Example of a show log:  </p> <pre><code>Sep 10 17:56:17 localhost EventMgr: %SYS-6-EVENT_TRIGGERED: Event handler ISP1-DOWN was activated  \nSep 10 17:56:18 localhost Ebra: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Ethernet3 (IPS-1), changed state to up  \nSep 10 17:56:18 localhost Rib: %BGP-3-NOTIFICATION: sent to neighbor 10.1.1.0 (AS 65010) 6/7 (Cease/connection collision resolution) 0 bytes   \nSep 10 17:56:18 localhost Rib: %BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: peer 10.1.1.0 (AS 65010) old state OpenConfirm event RecvKeepAlive new state Established  \nSep 10 17:56:20 localhost Lldp: %LLDP-5-NEIGHBOR_NEW: LLDP neighbor with chassisId 5000.00e4.7294 and portId \"Ethernet1\" added on interface Ethernet3  \n</code></pre> <p>Example Config with FastCli:  </p> <pre><code>event-handler ISP1-DOWN  \nAction Bash FastCli -p 15 -c $\u2019config \\n ip route 0.0.0.0/0 12.12.12.12\u2019   \ntrigger on-logging  \n   regex \"*\\(IPS1\\), changed to down\"\n</code></pre> <p>The above command adds new static default route that points traffic to a 12.12.12.12 address when a condition is triggered. </p> <p>I know what you are thinking now: \"If I can do this out of the box, why do I need Python?\" Even though you can create multiple Event-Handler instances to revert your configuration back and forth when conditions happen.  Adding a Python script allows you to execute more than one Bash command in response to a trigger, allowing a more granular approach to your automation process in one shot.  For example, not only can you change a default route when an interface goes down, but once it comes back up, the same script can check for routes and reachability before removing the temporary default route that was added when the link first went down. </p> <p>Example Config with Python script:  </p> <pre><code>event-handler ISP1-DOWN  \naction bash /mnt/flash/ISPdown.py &lt;- (This points to the location you put the script)  \ntrigger on-logging  \n   regex \"*\\(IPS1\\), changed to down\"\n</code></pre> <p>Resources: IP Static Route with Health Check Syslog Triggered Event Scripts Custom Event Handler </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
