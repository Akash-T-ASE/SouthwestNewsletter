Here's a quick update on how we're leading the way.  </p> <p>Revolutionizing SD-WAN with Standards-Based Innovation: SD-WAN has been a game-changer in networking for years, offering flexibility and cost savings. However, what sets Arista apart is our commitment to building on open standards, ensuring interoperability, and future-proofing your investments. Our Modern WAN Routing System leverages industry-standard protocols to create a robust and adaptive network fabric.  </p> <p>Key Highlights of Arista's SD-WAN 2.0:</p> <ul> <li>Seamless Connectivity: Our WAN Routing System connects enterprise branches, data centers, and head offices across diverse regions using the best available paths tailored to specific applications.  </li> <li>CloudVision Pathfinder: This centralized service ensures efficient path computation, enhancing performance and reliability.</li> <li>Dynamic Path Selection: By using Dynamic Path Selection (DPS), our system forwards application traffic over the most optimal path, whether MPLS or the internet, based on real-time conditions.  </li> <li>Enterprise-Grade Hardware: Our solution is built on secure, enterprise-grade hardware powered by Arista EOS and secure boot technology, ensuring robust performance and security.</li> </ul> <p>Adaptive Virtual Topology (AVT): Building on DPS, our AVT technology dynamically selects paths, ensuring that critical and latency-sensitive applications receive the best possible performance. This adaptability is crucial in today's fast-paced digital environment.  </p> <p>Standards-Based Approach: Our emphasis on using open standards means that our solutions integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructures and are prepared for future advancements. This approach not only protects your investment but also simplifies network management and scalability.</p> <p>Get In Touch: For more detailed information on our Modern WAN Routing System, reach out to your local account manager or systems engineering team. They are ready to provide insights and answer any questions you may have.</p> <p>Links for additional information: Dynamic Path Selection CloudVision AWE 7200R Datasheet </p>"},{"location":"#varp-virtual-address-resolution-protocol","title":"VARP (Virtual Address Resolution Protocol)","text":"<p>By: Steven King, Systems Engineer Southwest Region</p> <p>VARP is also called Layer-3 Anycast Gateway and is very simple to deploy. It is completely standards-based, and provides Active/Active behavior that HSRP and VRRP cannot replicate. Packets received on a VARP address are forwarded to the next hop destination on the same switch so that traffic does not need to traverse the inter-switch link.  This reduces latency and unnecessary load on switches. </p> <p> </p> <p>VARP works by responding to ARP requests for configured IP addresses with a configured virtual MAC address.  In the example below based off of your \u201csegment\u201d deployment diagram, two switches configured with VARP are providing a redundant first hop gateway to the downstream host, which resides in VLAN 1. Both switches respond to the host\u2019s ARP request.  </p> <p> </p> <p>An important item to note is that outside of ARP, traffic sent is not sourced from the virtual MAC address configured for VARP, but the switch\u2019s system MAC address instead.  To illustrate this point, consider the example below:  </p> <p> </p> <p>Two host machines are in two different VLANs with the switch acting as their default gateway, configured with VARP.  </p> <p>1) HOST 1 in VLAN 172 sends an ICMP ECHO request to Host 2 in VLAN 99; the destination MAC is that of its gateway residing on the switch, provided by the VARP virtual MAC address.  </p> <p>2) As the switch routes the request to HOST 2 in VLAN 99, the source MAC is not the virtual MAC address provided by VARP, but the switch\u2019s system MAC address.  </p> <p>Links for more information are below: Arista EOS Virtual ARP (VARP) Behind the Scenes Active-active router redundancy using VARP </p>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!
