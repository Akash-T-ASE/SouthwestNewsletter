CloudVision Studios was introduced with the aim of easing device configuration hardships by providing a simple to navigate interface for device provisioning. By leveraging Studios, network engineers can configure a large subset of devices without ever typing in a single line of CLI. At Arista, we are constantly improving the functionality of CloudVision, and Studios, being a feature within CloudVision, is no exception. We are constantly reimagining device provisioning methods, with our latest improvement coming in the form of a feature called \"Quick Actions.\"  </p> <p>The Access Interface Configuration Quick Action allows network operators to view their switch in CloudVision, displayed as an illustration of the front panel of the device.   </p> <p>  Front Panel Illustration </p> <p>From here, the operator can select as many interfaces as required, and dynamically assign \"Port Profiles\" to the interfaces.   </p> <p>NOTE: A Port Profile is a custom made profile intended to group common interface configuration settings into one location. For example, you can create a WIreless Access Point - Port Profile that sets the correct type of switchport, adds a description, adds any required vlans, and sets the speed, MTU, PTP settings, 802.1X configuration, PoE settings, and more. </p> <p>After assigning a port profile to an interface or subset of interfaces the network operator submits their change. The configuration parameters defined within the profile are leveraged to generate CLI configuration for the selected interfaces, which is then dynamically applied to each interface via a Change Control.  </p> <p>Furthermore, an operator can select specific interfaces and simply add a vlan to them, making day 2 tasks easy for network operators of all skillsets.   </p> <p>To learn more about the Access interface Configuration Quick Action, click the link below:  Quick Action Configuration </p>"},{"location":"#cloudvision-series-part-1-stay-aware-of-abnormal-network-behavior-with-event-alerts","title":"CloudVision Series Part 1: Stay Aware of Abnormal Network Behavior with Event Alerts","text":"<p>By: Akashdeep Takhar, Advanced Services Engineer, Southwest Region</p> <p>Image this scenario, which has unfortunately occurred to many network operators. Traffic loss across the network has significantly impacted end hosts. Neighboring devices cannot connect with their peers, perhaps a physical port is down. End users that depend on these networks are now complaining that they cannot connect to their applications, many tickets are created, a nightmare of stress hinders everyone\u2026..and the network team was informed of all this chaos unexpectedly without any warning. Event notifications system can assist in alerting your team for unforeseen circumstances, such as the ones discussed. This is where CloudVision\u2019s Event Notification tool can help your team!  </p> <p>The Event Notification tool is essential to use when utilizing CloudVision. Event Notifications communicate with 3rd party team collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, Google Chat, etc. via webhooks to send alerts directly to your team of desired destination. Not only is the team aware of anomalies within the Network as they occur, the team can also set threshold parameters with metrics to determine appropriate times to receive alerts. In this two part series, we\u2019ll look at where to navigate to configure event notifications messages. Next month, we\u2019ll show how to set threshold metrics to trigger the notifications to send messages.  </p> <p>  Direction to navigate towards the Event Notification section </p> <p>  Open the platform section </p> <p>Start by navigating to the \u201cEvent\u201d tab on the CloudVision portal on the left hand side of the page. Note that the pictures shown are of the latest version of CloudVision. If you currently run the previous version\u2019s UI, the \u201cEvents\u201d tab should be shown on top of the page.   </p> <p>Upon landing onto the \u201cEvents\u201d tab, navigate the mouse to the top right and click on \u201cEvent Notifications\u201d. This will bring you to the section where you can configure the platform to receive notifications upon. How exactly does CloudVision communicate to these 3rd party platforms? This is accomplished via Webhooks. Webhooks use APIs to send communication data between the two tools. Webhook are created by the 3rd party platform and are unique for where it is sending API calls to. Each platform has a simple guide on generating the Webhook for CloudVision to use. Upon generating the Webhook, you can simply paste it to CloudVision and begin to send test messages.  </p> <p>  Click on Receivers Tab </p> <p>Under the \u201cReceivers tab\u201d, create a \u201cReceiver\u201d to inform CloudVision where to send the alert towards. Although the Webhook is recorded within the \u201cPlatform\u201d tab, the \u201cReceiver\u201d tab finalizes the setting for CloudVision to recognize the receiving location.  </p> <p>By configuring Event Notifications, your team will be aware of ongoing concern within the Network. Rather than logging in to constantly monitor the network, CloudVision can help automate the monitoring task by sending alerts for abnormal behavior within the network fabric. Not only would this allow the team to quickly identify the matter, this would also allow the team to receive the issue faster than the end hosts bugging you about the issue.
